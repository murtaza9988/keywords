# Feature Implementation

## Mission
Deliver scoped features end-to-end with correct data flow and UI state.

## Entry criteria
- Feature spec or user story provided.
- Required routes/services/components identified.

## Exit criteria
- Feature works in UI and API paths.
- Tests or checks cover key paths.

## Required checks
- Validate API contract and frontend types.
- Ensure UI state updated and persisted correctly.

## Expected artifacts
- Summary of new endpoints and UI touchpoints.
- Tests or manual verification steps.

## Key files
- backend/app/routes/
- backend/app/services/
- frontend/src/app/
- frontend/src/components/

## Risks and gotchas
- Business logic placed in routers.
- Client components used unnecessarily.
