# Agent Runbooks

These runbooks define entry/exit criteria, required checks, and expected artifacts for each agent.

## How to use
1. Start with the first-principles mind map in AGENTS.md.
2. Choose the agent whose mission matches the intent.
3. Follow the entry criteria before changes.
4. Finish only when exit criteria and artifacts are satisfied.

## Standard runbook template
